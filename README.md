# List-Comphrehension-Python

Create squaring.py
# Instructions

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `squared_numbers`. This new list should contain every number in the list `numbers` but each number should be squared.

```
e.g. `4 * 4 = 16`
```

```
4 squared equals 16.
```

**DO NOT** modify the List `numbers` directly. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]
```

Create even_no.s.py
# Instructions

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `result`. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list `numbers`.

**DO NOT** modify the List `numbers` directly. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
[2, 8, 34]

Create Data Overlap.py
# Instructions

Take a look inside **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files. 

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

```
1
```

```
2
```

```
3
```

and file2.txt contained:

```
2
```

```
3
```

```
4
```

```
result = [2, 3] 
```

**IMPORTANT**: The result should be a list that contains **Integers**, not **Strings**. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.
